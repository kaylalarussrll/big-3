<h1>Big 3: A Codecademy Project - Mixed Messages</h1>

<p>This project was created for the Back-end Development career path. This project should generate 3 messages or strings of characters, that are posted in such a way that it 
builds a random sentence, or it creates a coherent story.</p>

<h2>Big 3: Purpose and Features</h2>
<p>Big 3 generates a persons big 3, and posts back any of the 12 astrological zodiac signs. It will also have a message appended that is specific to the sign generated, and
which position it is in. This means the message will differ if a sign like "virgo" shows up in the sun versus the rising position.</p>

<h4>A strictly JavaScript project.</h4>
